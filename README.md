Custom Statistics Software
So far this repository consists of a Stacked Box Plot grapher.  I created this because I needed to create stacked box plots for my AP Statistics class and wanted to be able to just copy data in from excel and graph, instead of having to do it on my graphing calculator and use a USB connection to transfer the graph of the data.
